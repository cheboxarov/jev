"""Recall in the 400-1200 line band, against the coverage a random window gets.

On a small file the shipped window is most of the file, so a high recall proves
little on its own: a window covering 73% of a file would catch a randomly placed
target 73% of the time. Every rule below is therefore reported next to its own
coverage, and the lift between them is the only thing that shows the tool is
doing work. Several window rules are scored from one API call each, so the cost
of comparing them is one request per target.
