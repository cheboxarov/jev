// Command jev answers questions about a codebase without the answers' source
// material entering an agent's context.
//
// An agent pays for its context on every turn, not once: a file read early in a
// session is re-sent with every later request. jev reads the files itself,
// sends them to a model that charges $0.042 per million tokens, and returns a
// few lines. The bytes are read once, by something cheap, and never come back.

const rootUsage = `jev — answer questions about code without reading it into context

usage: jev <command> [flags] [arguments]

commands:
  find    rank files against a plain-language description of what you want
  ask     put a yes/no question to one or more files
  scan    dry run: what would be sent, and what it would cost (no API call)
  probe   verify the API contract and print a raw response
  gain    show what jev has cost and how much it read out-of-context

  jev find "where is the register flow"
  jev ask "does this retry on failure?" internal/app/api.go
  jev gain

Set OPENROUTER_API_KEY in your environment (TYPE_SAFE_AI_KEY also works). Run "jev <command> -h" for flags.
